# Compiles the device app's icon for SP_PLATFORM (scripts/platform.sh) into a directory whose contents go
# in the app's root:
#   apps/client/build-icons.sh <dir>
# On iOS the icon is icons/AppIcon.icon, the Icon Composer icon the companion uses too (a solid
# background under two glass layers, the medallion and the S; actool also writes the loose
# AppIcon60x60@2x.png and AppIcon76x76@2x~ipad.png older lookups use). visionOS has no .icon, so
# icons/xros.xcassets holds its three-layer solid image stack (back, middle, front; the system masks it
# to a circle), rendered from the same layers. The device app isn't an Xcode
# target, so actool runs here; the Info.plist keys that name the icon are in sp_plist's @PLATFORM_KEYS@
# (and ClientAssembly.Platform.platformKeys), as actool's partial Info.plist has them (on iOS both the
# iPhone's CFBundleIcons and the iPad's CFBundleIcons~ipad; the files are the same with either device).
# apps/client/build.sh compiles straight into its app; the companion's bundle-resources.sh into
# Resources/<platform>/icon/, which ClientAssembly copies, so the user's Mac never runs actool. Sources:
# art/ (README there).
