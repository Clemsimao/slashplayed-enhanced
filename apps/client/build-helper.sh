# Unsigned, like build-launcher.sh: apps/client/build.sh puts it in the app it builds, the companion's
# bundle-resources.sh in the companion, which assembles the app itself. The appex's Info.plist is the
# template helper/Info.plist, filled when the app is assembled (its bundle ID is the app's plus .helper).
# Links idevice (scripts/build-idevice.sh <platform> builds it into work/idevice/), which the helper needs
# for all its work: the RemotePairing tunnel, the disk image, and the debugger.
